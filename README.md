# DerivativeApproximationProgram
The derivative approximation program is a tool designed to calculate the approximation of a derivative using four different methods: Mid-point approximation, left approximation, right approximation, and trapezoidal approximation.

The user can modify the limits used in the program to calculate the approximation. By adjusting the limits, the program can calculate the derivative of any function in the desired range. Additionally, the user can select the number of geometric figures to be used, which will impact the precision of the approximation. The more geometric figures used, the more precise the result.

The midpoint approximation method uses the average slope between two points, the left approximation method uses the slope of the line tangent to the left endpoint of a small interval, the right approximation method uses the slope of the line tangent to the right endpoint of a small interval, and the trapezoidal approximation method calculates the area of a trapezoid formed by the line between two points.

The program outputs the approximation of the derivative using each of the four methods, allowing the user to compare the results and select the most accurate one. With this tool, users can easily and quickly calculate derivative approximations to better understand the behavior of functions within a certain range.
